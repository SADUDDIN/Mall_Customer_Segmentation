📌 Project Overview
This project applies Autoencoders and K-Means clustering to segment customers based on their Age, Annual Income, and Spending Score. By using deep learning, we extract meaningful features, improve clustering accuracy, and gain insights into customer behavior.

🔍 Key Features
✔ Autoencoder for Feature Extraction – Reduces data dimensionality and removes noise.
✔ K-Means Clustering – Groups customers into 6 optimal segments based on extracted features.
✔ PCA for Visualization – Reduces high-dimensional data to 2D for better interpretation.
✔ Cluster Analysis – Understands spending patterns and customer behaviors.

📂 Dataset
The dataset contains the following features:
CustomerID (Unique ID)
Gender (Male/Female)
Age
Annual Income (k$)
Spending Score (1-100)
